# Machine Learning Projects Generally Follow this format:
    #1. Import the data
    #2. Clean the data
    #3. Split the data into Training/Test Sets
    #4. Create the model using an algorithm such as decision trees,neural networks, etc...
    #5. Train the model
    #6. Make predictions
    #7. Evaluate and improve

# Libraries and Tools for machine learning:
    # Numpy: Provides a multidimensional array
    # Pandas: Data Analysis Library that provides a concept called dataframes. Dataframes are like excel spreadsheets with rows and columns.
    # MatPlotLib: a plotting library for creating 2D graphs and plots
    # Scikit-Learn: Library that contains alot of the common Machine Learning Algorithms


# Jupyter Notebook commands
    # H: Shows a list of shortcuts
    # Esc and B: Insert cell below selected cell
    # Esc and A: Insert cell above selected cell
    # Esc D, D: Delete selected cell
    # Tab: shows all the methods for an object or method
    # Ctrl /: Turns a cell into a comment
